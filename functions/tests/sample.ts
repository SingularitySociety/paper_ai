  "title": "Large Language Model is a Good Policy Teacher for Training Reinforcement\n  Learning Agents",
  "summary": "Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized\nfor solving complex sequential decision-making tasks by providing high-level\ninstructions. However, LLM-based agents face limitations in real-time dynamic\nenvironments due to their lack of specialization in solving specific target\nproblems. Moreover, the deployment of such LLM-based agents is both costly and\ntime-consuming in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework that addresses these challenges by training a smaller scale\nspecialized student agent using instructions from an LLM-based teacher agent.\nBy leveraging guided actions provided by the teachers, the prior knowledge of\nthe LLM is distilled into the local student model. Consequently, the student\nagent can be trained with significantly less data. Furthermore, subsequent\ntraining with environment feedback empowers the student agents to surpass the\ncapabilities of their teachers. We conducted experiments on three challenging\nMiniGrid environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. The\nresults demonstrate that our approach enhances sample efficiency and achieves\nsuperior performance compared to baseline methods.",
